          <h2>What Is Clash Royale You Ask...</h2>
          <p>Well, Clash Royale is a fast paced, card based player vs player brawler. Collect Clash troops, and use them to wreak havoc on your opponentâ€™s towers! Whoever has the most opponent towers eliminated at the end of the time wins! Or take out the opponent completely by knocking out all 3 towers to claim instant victory! </p>
          <h2>Yeah, So... What Am I Doing Here?</h2>
          <p>You are here to create the Ultimate Clash Royale deck.</p>
